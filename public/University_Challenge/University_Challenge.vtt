00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.760
Right, fingers on buzzers.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.000
Here is your first starter for ten.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.200
Believed to date to the first century CE,
the practice known by the Latin term interpretatio germanica,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.320
or German interpretation, refers to the naming
of what common set of proper nouns?

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.320
This practice substituted the names of local 
deities for figures such as Mars, Mercury...

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.720
Days of the week.
It is days of the week, yes.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Three questions for you, UCL, on the medieval Egyptian ruler Baybars.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.840
Baybars ruled which sultanate centred on Cairo from 1260 to 1277?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.000
The successor of the Ayyubid sultanate, its name refers to the military 
caste that controlled the state whose name comes from the Arabic for slave.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.640
Mamluk. Mamluk.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.800
Correct. Before his accession as sultan, Baybars 
was one of the commanders in the Battle of Ain Jalut.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.600
This Egyptian victory halted the 
southwestern expansion of which empire?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.400
The Mongol. Mongol Empire.
Correct.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:58.000
Baybars was also a commander of the army that repelled the Seventh Crusade 
and captured which ruler, the only king of France to be canonised?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I need a name and regnal number.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.600
Louis IX.
Louis IX.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.760

Another starter question.

what city did Wordsworth describe as the eldest child of liberty?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.760
Mary Elizabeth Coleridge mentioned it along with
Troy and Rome, stating that its "pride is nought."

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.160

nursling", while Byron said that it was...

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.360
Athens? No, and I'm afraid
you lose five points.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.520
..while Byron said that it once was 
"the revel of the earth, the masque of Italy."

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000

Your bonuses, UCL, are on biological
terms that start with the same three letters.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.240
In each case, identify the term
from the description given.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:27.360
First, an organism or tissue that contains at least two different
sets of DNA, often from the fusion of different zygotes.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.000
This term is also the name of a monster

The cross-shaped connection produced by the crossing
over of homologous chromosomes during meiosis.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.400
In the singular, this term has
seven letters.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.040
So it'll begin C-H-I.
Yeah.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.000
So...

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Chi...

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.600
No. Seven letters.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.720
No. Yeah. Chiron? Pass.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.880
It's chiasma.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:59.120
