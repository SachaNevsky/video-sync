ERIC TAO: Harpsichord,
anything granular to watch?

00:00:08.195 --> 00:00:10.398
Uh... employment rate?

00:00:10.598 --> 00:00:12.167
(CHUCKLES) No shit.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:15.770
Sorry, I'm looking
at wage growth too.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.141

DUNCAN: (OVER PHONE)<i> I've just
spoken to Aubrey at Allerton.</i>

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.177
<i> Why did you lie to me?</i>

00:00:23.644 --> 00:00:25.380
You're middle office, you
shouldn't be calling clients.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.647
DUNCAN:<i> You made a mistake.</i>

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:28.450
<i> So what the fuck
do you think you're doing?</i>

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:31.820
Fifteen seconds to the print.
It's gonna be soft,

00:00:31.887 --> 00:00:32.787
then we're clear.

00:00:33.354 --> 00:00:35.023
DUNCAN:<i> No, Harper, you can't
trade your way out of this!</i>

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.125
<i> That is unacceptable,
 it's reckless.</i>

00:00:37.225 --> 00:00:38.393
This is where we are now.

00:00:39.027 --> 00:00:40.295
-DUNCAN:<i> Harper!</i>
-HARPER: Just wait.

00:00:40.495 --> 00:00:42.230

THEO TUCK:
Big miss on the number.

00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:52.773

DUNCAN:<i> Okay. Pull up
the trade input loss sheet.</i>

00:00:58.446 --> 00:00:59.848
<i>I shouldn't be doing this.</i>

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:02.517
It's already done.

DUNCAN:<i> Execute anywhere
 within ten grand</i>

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.220
<i>and you might get rid of this.</i>

00:01:06.921 --> 00:01:09.223
This move's one-way traffic,
print is soft, I'm running it.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.259
DUNCAN:
<i>Harper, don't fuck around.</i>

00:01:11.325 --> 00:01:13.295
<i> Cover that risk now.</i>

00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:18.166
<i> -Harper!</i>
-There's a reason

00:01:18.232 --> 00:01:20.235

It's fucking Ivor, man!
Storb now, too.

00:01:40.121 --> 00:01:42.124
