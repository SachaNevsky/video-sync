Mate, I'm glad I'm not taking a position on this print.
Harpsichord, anything important to watch?
Uh... employment rate?
Of course
Sorry, I'm looking at wage growth too.
What?
I just spoke to Aubrey at Allerton.
Why did you lie to me?
You're middle office. You shouldn't call clients.
You made a mistake.
So what are you doing?
Fifteen seconds to the print. It's gonna be soft, then we're clear.
No, Harper, you can't trade your way out of this!
That's not okay. It's reckless.
This is where we are now.
Harper! Just wait.
The announcement is in five seconds.
Big miss on the number.
Plus 120, versus street at plus 250.
What did I say?
Told you.
Okay. Pull up the trade loss sheet.
I shouldn't do this.
It's already done.
Execute within ten grand and you might fix this.
This move is one-way traffic. The print is soft. I'm running it.
Harper, don't mess around.
Cover that risk now.
Harper! There's a reason I'm here. Trust me.
Ivor's buying dollars.
It's Ivor, man! Storb now, too.
First move is always wrong.
Damn, Eric, Ivor is hitting us hard, mate.
Of course he is, he trades with me.
Harper, I will broadcast this if you don't execute now! It'll come back.
Punch it! Wait!
I'm not messing around!
All good? Absolutely, of course.
