Hello and welcome to world news today.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:17.800
If you want a new adventure and have a lot of money
you could soon book a trip to the International Space Station.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.500
On Friday, NASA announced it will open the
International Space Station for tourism and business.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.700
There will be up to two private missions per year.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.500
We are allowing private astronaut missions
to the International Space Station. 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:42.800
NASA will support up to two private missions
per year starting as early as 2020.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.900
These private missions will allow approved
commercial activities on the station.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.500
So now you know.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.100
Keith Cowing is an astrobiologist and former NASA 
employee who edits the online blog NASA Watch.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.300
Keith, what do you make of this?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:13.200
It’s not surprising. The space station has had commercial
visitors before by the Russians, but it was improvised.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:21.200
Now NASA has clarified the process for doing 
commercial activities in the space station.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.500
It’s clear now, like an advert for a resort 
where you can choose activities and then pay.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.900
What’s the incentive? Bringing more
private money into space research?

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.000
There has been interest in commercializing
the space station for many years.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.200
With NASA's plans to return to the moon,
they are looking to offset some costs.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.200
But President Trump tweeted that NASA should not talk
about going back to the moon, so things might change.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:08.800
The idea is to move routine activities closer to Earth, 
save money, and fund NASA's exploration of new frontiers.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:15.160
It’s about re-balancing payments for a bigger plan of exploration.
