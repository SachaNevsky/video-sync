00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.220
Where are the belts for this jacket?

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.660
Why is no one ready?

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.580
Here. It's a tough call.
They're so different.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.560
Mm...

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.460
Something funny?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:28.360
Oh... no, no, n-nothing's you know, it's just that both those belts look exactly the same to me.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.660
You know, I'm still learning about this stuff and, uh...

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.400
"This... stuff"?

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.780
Oh. Okay. I see.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.220
You think this has nothing to do with you.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.880
You... go to your closet and you select, I don't know, that lumpy blue sweater, for instance

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.380
... because you're trying to tell the world that you take yourself too seriously to care about what you put on your back.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.180
But what you don't know is that that sweater is not just blue,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.220
it's not turquoise, it's not lapis, it's actually cerulean.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.460
And you're also blithely unaware of the fact that in 2002, Oscar de la Renta did a collection of cerulean gowns.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.980
And then I think it was Yves Saint Laurent... wasn't it? Who showed cerulean military jackets?

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.020
I think we need a jacket here.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.000
Mm.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.540
And then cerulean quickly showed up in the collections of eight different designers.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.060
And then it, uh, filtered down through the department stores

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.480
... and then trickled on down into some tragic Casual Corner where you, no doubt, fished it out of some clearance bin.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.060
However, that blue represents millions of dollars and countless jobs

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.680
... and it's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.400
... when, in fact, you're wearing the sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.260
... from a pile of stuff.
